## Game Functionality

The goal of the player in the game is to cross the stone area and reach the water. The player has to be careful so that he does not collide with the enemy(bug) else the game resets and the score achieved will be lost. If the player manages to reach water, the score will be incremented and the player gets to play the game again to achieve a new best score.
